# AI-Powered Cybersecurity Threat Detection System

The AI-Powered Cybersecurity Threat Detection System is designed to identify and mitigate cyber threats in real time. By leveraging machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), the system can analyze network traffic, detect anomalies, and predict potential security threats before they escalate.

## Project Phases

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
2. **AI Model Training**  
3. **Model Deployment (API Integration)**  
4. **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard**  
5. **Testing & Validation**
